# Lottery-Generator 
## About The Project ðŸ“š

This project was proposed by the teacher of Computational Mathematics course at University of Fortaleza (UNIFOR)
We've been requested to develop a random number lottery slip (6 random numbers) using any method we see fit.<br>
After deciding to move forward with javascript and Math.random, we also commented on the particularities of this method, the idea of pseudo-random
numbers and how companies and the governement come up with random numbers for their applications, with focus on security.
We also used the RANDOM.ORG api to generate 6 random numbers and comment about its differences during our presentation.
Development in collaboration with [Rafael Saboia](https://github.com/rafaelsaboia)

## Usage
Click the button "Sortear NÃºmeros" to generate 6 random numbers.<br>
We've also included the possibility to generate as many numbers as you'd like, just type in the amount you want (ie. 100), and click the<br>
"Desenhar GrÃ¡fico" button. This will show on a Histogram the numbers generated and its ocurrences counter in the chart.<br>
We used that to show that on a 'perfect scenario' the random number should have the same ocurrences for all numbers, and that can be<br>
verified with the increase of numbers on the histogram.
